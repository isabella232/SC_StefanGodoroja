## Introduction

Hey what’s up everybody, this is Brian. In today's screencast I'm going to introduce you to Apple Pay service and how it can be integrated
in your own app.

First, I’d like to thank Ștefan Godoroja for preparing the materials for this course and tech_editor_name for acting as tech editor. Check them out on twitter!

Apple Pay is a fast, easy and secured way to pay in your iOS and watchOS apps or in SiriKit extensions. Users can provide payments, shipping and contact information to checkout securely by using FaceID, TouchID or double-click the side button on Apple Watch. Think of Apple Pay as
an express checkout which doesn't require each time to add a bank card or to fill out lengthy forms to complete the purchase. As a bonus, Apple runs promotions for apps that uses Apple Pay.

We'll integrate Apple Pay in our app called Shinyture, developed for selling furniture items. We'll touch key moments like
payment flow architecture, best practices when dealing with Apple Pay, enabling project to use Apple Pay and common API for making payments.
